# Health Data Save

## Description

Health Data Save (HDS) is a project aimed at maintaining users' health data saved in a secure and reliable database. The idea is to create a complete patient history, including all consultations, exams, results, diagnoses, and medical prescriptions.

## How It Works

HDS is a platform that allows healthcare professionals to insert and access their patients' data in an easy and organized way. Users can create an account and add their personal and medical information, allowing healthcare professionals to access their data at any time.

## Target Audience

The project is primarily aimed at individuals who want to have control over their health status and medical history, from medical prescriptions to the latest medical. The project offers healthcare professionals the ability to access patients' medical history more easily and accurately in order to provide a more concise diagnosis.

## Resources:

**Patients** - Will be able to create an account, manage their personal and health information, manage authorization for who can access their health information, add information about consultations, schedule reminders for future consultations and exams, among other functions.

**Healthcare Professionals** - Will be able to access the patient's medical record, from consultations or exams performed, organized by dates and type, as well as medical prescriptions and medications purchased by the patient (when registered on the platform). Healthcare professionals will also be able to make changes and add information to the patient's medical record when necessary.

## Data Security

Describe how you plan to ensure the security of collected and stored data, taking into account the main data protection laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

   - Encryption - All data will be encrypted to ensure that patient information is kept secure and confidential. This includes using end-to-end encryption technologies such as TLS and SSL.

   - Data Protection - Rigorous protocols will be implemented to protect patient data from security threats such as cyber attacks and phishing. This includes adopting cybersecurity measures such as antivirus, firewall, and password protection, as well as secure data management practices such as data backup and recovery.

   - Access Control - Data access controls will be established, ensuring that only authorized users can access patient information. This includes adopting user authentication techniques such as secure login and password, as well as role-based access restrictions.

   - Patient Consent - All patients will be asked to provide explicit consent for the use of their data in compliance with applicable data protection laws. This includes obtaining patient consent to collect, store, and share their health data with authorized healthcare professionals and other stakeholders such as insurance providers.

   - Continuous Monitoring - The platform will be continuously monitored to ensure that all data is stored and handled in accordance with data protection laws. This includes conducting regular penetration testing, security analysis, and compliance reviews to ensure that security standards are maintained and threats are detected and addressed promptly.

## User Interface

HDS will have up to four interfaces available for patients to access their health data. These interfaces may have different limitations or be more complete. Platform or interface options include Web, mobile, SMS or RCS (if the device allows) and ussd code. For doctors and other healthcare professionals, an API will be made available to allow integration with systems from private or public-private clinics, pharmacies, etc. Additionally, the HDS development team will create a desktop software for use by healthcare professionals.

## Future plans

HDS is still in the development phase and may undergo changes as new features are added or others are removed. We are committed to ensuring that our users have access to the best tools and resources to manage their health.
